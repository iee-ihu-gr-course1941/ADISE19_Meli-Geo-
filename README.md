uno-game
This is an implementation in PHP and JS of the classic card game UNO.
2 players(Human-human)

Deck:
19 blue cards - 0 to 9;
19 red cards - 0 to 9;
19 yellow cards - 0 to 9;
19 green cards - 0 to 9;
8 “Draw Two” cards- two of each color;
8 “Skip” cards- two of each color;
8 “Reverse” cards- two of each color;
4 “Wild” cards;
4 “Wild Draw Four” cards.

Info:
7 cards are dealt out to each player in the beginning of the game. A player may always draw a card from the deck.
If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck.
In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like the Skip card.
